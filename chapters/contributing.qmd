## Images

### Background

Images are stored on [UHH Cloud]({{< var project.images-url >}}) (based on [Nextcloud]({{< var links.nextcloud >}})).
They are downloaded into the `/images` folder using the command specified in the `Makefile`.

### Installation

You need to install the following software:

1. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
1. [curl](https://curl.se/)

These tools might already be installed on your system.
Click on the box below for instructions for your operating system:

```

2. After you installed Homebrew, install [GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)

### Retrieve images

To access the images in the project directory, they need to be downloaded into the project folder.
For convenience, we provide a `make` command (using [GNU Make]({{< var links.gnu-make >}})):

```{zsh filename="Code"}
make images
```

::: {.callout-tip title="What is a Makefile and what does it do?" collapse="true"}

```{bash, filename="Makefile"}
#| file: Makefile
#| code-line-numbers: true
```

### Add a new image

1. Become a collaborator on the [UHH Cloud folder]({{< var project.images-url >}}).
1. Go to the [UHH Cloud folder]({{< var project.images-url >}}).
1. Place the new image inside the folder.
Please use `-` to separate word in the filename.
1. Reference the image in the Quarto document relative to the root of the project directory:

```{markdown}
![](static/NEW-IMAGE.png)
```

### Download images in pre-render command

It's also possible to include the `make static` as a project script in the `pre-render` script.
This would re-execute `make static` before every render.
For the moment, we disabled this option, but it can be enabled in `_quarto.yml`.
