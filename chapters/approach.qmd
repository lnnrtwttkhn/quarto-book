## What is this book about?

In short, the book focuses on the necessary elements of FAIR values, namely, *Findable*, *Accessible*, *Interoperable*, and *Reusable* materials, using [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/). This book aims familiarize the reader with Quarto, a powerful tool for crafting educational FAIR contents with hands-on examples. Our guide is not a replacement for Quarto documentation. We don't want to teach Quarto from A to Z, rather, we aim to orient Quarto's capabilities towards creating teaching materials and reproducible research.
=======

Quarto has several features that make it a perfect fit as the cornerstone for making FAIR materials. It can be easily synchronized with different platforms like Git, which is a huge advantage compared to other word processor programs like Microsoft Word. This shareability feature is the first and arguably the most important step in creating FAIR content, that opens numerous opportunities for the scientific community, such as contributing to others' works or computational examination of their research.

## How to use this guide?

Quarto is the intersection of various tools. It is a text editor, a slide crafting tool, a website builder, and a code compiler all at once. We recommend integrating the use of Quarto with your existing material development process. For example, if you are in the middle of developing materials for your lectures, use Quarto alongside your current method of developing these materials for a small portion of the content. This approach helps you get to know Quarto better and adapt its abilities to your purpose.

Below, is a scenario generated by Chat-GPT based on Quarto capabilities. I think it becomes more understandable to explain Quarto with tangible examples. I can come up with a new scenario, modify or change it, but the general idea remains the same.

**Scenario for explaining how Quarto's intersectionality helps researchers:**

Dr. Smith, a researcher in computational biology, is working on a project with colleagues across several institutions. They need to create a set of teaching materials and reproducible research protocols that comply with FAIR principles, ensuring their work is easily sharable and reusable by others in the scientific community.

Using Quarto as their primary tool, Dr. Smith and her team synchronize their documents with GitHub, enabling real-time collaboration. As they develop their materials, they seamlessly integrate code, data visualizations, and explanations within a single document. Quarto’s ability to compile everything into slides, websites, and reports allows them to disseminate their work widely, in multiple formats, without needing to rely on separate tools.

Because Quarto supports version control and synchronization, team members can effortlessly contribute to each other's work. For example, Dr. Lee, based in a different country, can pull the latest version of the project from GitHub, review the materials, and add suggestions or corrections directly in the Quarto files.

The real-time sharing feature of Quarto also facilitates the reproducibility of their research. Dr. Smith’s team can publish not just the final reports, but also the underlying code, datasets, and computational steps used to reach their conclusions, allowing other researchers to run the same analysis on their own datasets. This transparency encourages collaboration, helps others validate findings, and ultimately contributes to the broader scientific discourse.

In this scenario, Quarto's synchronization and shareability allow the team to efficiently collaborate across platforms, produce diverse formats of materials, and contribute to the growing body of FAIR research, all within a single tool.
