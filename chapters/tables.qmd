### Tables

To draw a table on Quarto, you should draw a table! Let's find out with an example:

``` markdown
| Fruits | Animals|  Trees |
|:------:|:-------|-------:|
| Orange |  Tiger |Sequoia |
| Apple  |Dolphin | Cedar  |
| Banana |  Wolf  | Pine   |
```

| Fruits | Animals |   Trees |
|:------:|:--------|--------:|
| Orange | Tiger   | Sequoia |
| Apple  | Dolphin |   Cedar |
| Banana | Wolf    |    Pine |

As you see, adding `:` to the left, right or both sides of the dashes will affect the alignment of a column. For further customization options regarding tables see [Quarto's documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) on tables.
