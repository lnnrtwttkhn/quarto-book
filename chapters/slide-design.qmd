## More Beautiful Slides!
Using Quarto themes, the output will be more stylistic.
Currently, there are 11 prebuilt themes available (`beige`, `blood`, `dark`, `default`, `league`, `moon`, `night`, `serif`, `simple`, `sky`, `solarized`).
It is also possible to use other themes that people have developed.
To apply the theme, you have to change the `yml` header.

```yml

format:
  revealjs: 
    theme: league

```
