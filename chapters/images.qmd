### Images

In the simplest form, images can be added to a Quarto document by using

``` markdown
![Description](image address)
```

Images can also be turned into links. It is basically combining the syntax of an image and a link together:

``` markdown
[![Description](image address)](Link)
```

For better accessibility, it is possible and recommended to add alt text to the images.

``` markdown
[![Description](image address){fig-alt="Alt text"}](Link)
```
