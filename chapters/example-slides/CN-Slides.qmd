## Reduction in Gray Matter (GM) Volume

- Fontal regions (including prefrontal cortex), striatum and hippocampus seem to be most affected by this age-induced deterioration while the occipital lobe remains the least affected.

- More recently, also found changes  in GM volume in the cerebellum.

## Reduction in White Matter (WM) Integrity

- White matter is the the myelin sheath surrounding neuronal axons.

- Inverted U shape relationship between white matter changes and age.

- May explain some of the age-related changes seen in processing speed.
