# The FAIR Framework

Since science has transitioned from pens and paper to keyboards and monitors, developing a suitable and appropriate approach to archiving, reproducing, sharing, and collaborating on scientific outputs seems inevitable. One of the most well-known frameworks developed by @wilkinson2016 to define best practices in research data management is the **FAIR** principles. FAIR stands for ***Findable***, ***Accessible***, ***Interoperable***, and ***Reusable***. The FAIR principles serve as a guide to achieving better data management. They enable data to be ***machine actionable***, meaning they equip autonomous computational systems with detailed, structured information while exploring the data.

## What is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable?

According to the FAIR principles:

-   data are **Findable**,

    -   when they are indexed in a searchable resource,
    -   described with excessive metadata,
    -   have a unique identifier such as a DOI,
    -   include the identifier in the metadata.

-   **Accessible data**,

    -   can be accessed through their identifier,
    -   has a free, universally accessible, and open protocol,
    -   supports authentication processes when required
    -   have an accessible metadata regardless of the data availability.

-   **Interoperable** data and metadata,

    -   present knowledge in a standard language.
    -   adapt with FAIR terminology.
    -   contain references to other data or metadata .

-   **Reusable** means,

    -   data and metadata are attributed accurately.
    -   data and metadata have suitable data usage licenses.
    -   data and metadata are connected thoroughly.
    -   data and metadata meet the standards of the respective scientific community.

Since the FAIR values are principles that guide researchers along their scientific journey, we directly quote @wilkinson2016's definition of every principle to leave no room for interpretation:

## To be Findable:

**F1.** (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.

**F2.** data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below).

**F3.** metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes.

**F4.** (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## To be Accessible:

**A1.** (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.

**A1.1.** the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.

**A1.2.** the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.

**A2.** metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## To be Interoperable:

**I1.** (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

**I2.** (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.

**I3.** (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## To be Reusable

**R1.** meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.

**R1.1.** (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.

**R1.2.** (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance.

**R1.3.** (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

# A Bridge from FAIR for Research Data to Educational Resources

With most of the focus being on the FAIRness of the data, not enough attention is paid to the materials that actually educate the future researchers.
Throughout this guide, we argue that not only research data can be FAIR, but the same principles are also applicable to the teaching materials.
It means by using the suitable framework, the educational contents produced in numerous institutions around the globe can become FAIR and even go beyond the aforementioned values.
We rely on two tools that we think are fundamental for making such educational materials, namely Git and Quarto. As this guide focuses on Quarto, [another guide](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book) written by [Lennart Wittkuhn](https://lennartwittkuhn.com) and Konrad Pagenstedt (2024) on Git, which is recommended reading, as Quarto and Git can be extremely powerful tools when used together.
