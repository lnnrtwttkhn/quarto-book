## Slides are More FAIR with Quarto
An important part of teaching is presenting.
PowerPoint presentations are widely used across educational settings.
However, PowerPoint comes with several constraints in terms of FAIRness.
PowerPoint slides can't be version controlled.  
As discussed in the previous chapters, the Quarto-Git integration is a powerful feature that enables the version controllability of slides crafted in Quarto.  
Other general advantages of Quarto are also applicable to creating slides.

For instance, the reproducibility of PowerPoint slides on other systems is often a problem.  
To run smoothly, PowerPoint slides need the fonts used on the original system.  
There are also compatibility limitations, as one can't be sure that the versions will run the same on different machines.  
If one embeds the fonts, animations, images, etc., in PowerPoint, then the slides can't be edited on other machines.

In this chapter, we show how to create basic slides in Quarto.

## First step
The first step to create slides on Quarto is changing the `format` to `revealjs` in the `yml` header.

```yml

---
title: "My First Presentation on Quarto"
format: revealjs
---

```

## Let's Start!
Using level 2 headings `##`, your first slide is created.

```yml

## Reduction in Gray Matter (GM) Volume

- Fontal regions (including prefrontal cortex), striatum and hippocampus seem to be most affected by this age-induced deterioration while the occipital lobe remains the least affected.

- More recently, also found changes  in GM volume in the cerebellum.

## Reduction in White Matter (WM) Integrity

- White matter is the the myelin sheath surrounding neuronal axons.

- Inverted U shape relationship between white matter changes and age.

- May explain some of the age-related changes seen in processing speed.
